Version 5.0.\\n\\nPROTOCOL SUMMARY\\n\\nProtocol Title\\n\\nDouble-blind, Double-dummy, Phase 2 Randomized, Multicenter, Proof-of-\\nConcept, Safety and Efficacy Trial to Evaluate Different Oral Benznidazole\\nMonotherapy and Benznidazole/E1224 Combination Regimens for the Treatment\\nof Adult Patients with Chronic Indeterminate Chagas Disease\\n\\nPhase\\n\\nInvestigational — Phase 2 trial\\n\\nIndication\\n\\nChronic Indeterminate Chagas Disease\\n\\nProtocol\\nNumber\\n\\nDNDi-CH-E1224-003\\n\\nBackground\\nInformation\\nand Trial\\nRationale\\n\\nThe current treatment for Chagas disease has significant limitations, including long\\ntreatment durations, safety and tolerability concerns and is currently limited to two\\nnitro-heterocyclic drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN). BZN, a nitroimidazole\\nintroduced by Roche in 1971, is marketed by Laboratério Farmacéutico do Estado\\nde Pernambuco S/A — LAFEPE and Laboratorio ELEA — Argentina. It is supplied\\nin tablets strengths of 12.5, 50 and 100 mg, administered twice daily at a dose of\\n5 mg/kg body weight/day for adults and 5-10 mg/kg body weight/day for children\\nfor 30-60 days. Notably, the current regimens with BZN for the treatment of adults\\nwith CD likely represent the maximum dosing case scenario in terms of dose,\\nduration and schedule of administration (Chagas expert meeting DNDi. January\\n2014. GVA).\\n\\nDoses and duration of treatment for CD have not been evaluated systematically.\\nCurrent treatment regimens and dosing intervals have been derived from decades-\\nold patient series and with very limited direct comparisons. Data from recently\\nconcluded trials suggest existing opportunities for optimisation of the treatment\\nregimens of BZN.\\n\\nA DNDi-sponsored Phase 2, proof-of-concept clinical trial on E1224 and BZN in\\nadults with chronic indeterminate CD, conducted between 2011 and 2013 in\\nBolivia, showed that all BZN-treated patients had cleared parasite DNA after 2\\nweeks of treatment and 81% sustained the parasite clearance at 12 months after\\ntreatment. At end-of treatment (EOT, Day 65), E1224 was found to be efficacious\\nin clearing T. cruzi parasites when compared to placebo. However, at 12 months\\nless than one third of patients sustained parasite clearance. The trial safety data\\nalso indicated a proportion of patients (10-20%) who do not complete treatment in\\nconditions of use, the majority due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the long\\ntreatment duration.\\n\\nTaking into consideration the efficacy gap with about 80% sustained response and\\na tolerability gap, with a proportion of patients (10-20%) who do not complete\\ntreatment, two approaches for Chagas treatment optimization are to be pursued:\\n\\n1) Achange in the current adult dosing regimen for BNZ to reduce exposure and\\nimprove tolerability while maintaining efficacy; and\\n\\n2) The development of a combination therapy to improve efficacy while maintaining\\nor improving tolerability. The combination therapy aims to address the efficacy gap\\nand may or may not address tolerability gap.\\n\\nWith regards to the dosing regimen, population-pharmacokinetics studies\\nobserved BZN plasma concentrations in children were significantly lower than\\nthose previously reported in adults (treated with comparable mg/kg doses). At the\\nsame time, all children had parasite clearance, few adverse reactions to the drug.\\nRecent population PK data in adults suggested that the current BZN dosing\\n\\nConfidential\\n\\nPage 10 of 87\\n\\n\\n\\n=== Page 12 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018. Version 5.0.\\n\\nregimen (2.5 mg/kg/12 h) may lead to overexposure in the majority of patients.\\nDosing simulations suggested that a BNZ dose of 2.5 mg/kg/24 h would adequately\\nkeep BNZ trough plasma concentrations within the recommended target range for\\nthe majority of patients. There are also opportunities for evaluation of fixed dose\\nregimens for adult dosing, rather than mg/kg calculations, with increased ease-of-\\nuse and potential for improved compliance in scaling up treatment of CD.\\nIntermittent dosing regimens was also evaluated in murine model of chronic CD\\nand in a pilot follow-up trial with 17 adult patients with chronic CD was, with similar\\nparasitological cure rates to standard treatment.\\n\\nLikewise, several controlled observational trials with BZN, 5 mg/kg/day for 30 or 60\\ndays have shown a reduction in the progression of heart disease serological and\\nsero-negative conversion up to 60% in children and 30% in adults. Different\\npublications showed anti-parasitic efficacy of treatment regimens with 30 and 60\\ndays, and of incomplete treatment of 10 days. Combination therapy is a well-\\nrecognized treatment modality in many disease settings, including cancer,\\ncardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases. Several infectious diseases such\\nas tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, and AIDS only came under control and were\\neffectively treated after introduction of combinations of drugs that utilize different\\nmechanisms of action.\\n\\nE1224 is a water-soluble monolysine salt form of the ravuconazole (RAV) pro-drug\\n(which is a phosphonooxymethyl ether derivative of RAV). It is a broad-spectrum\\ntriazole antifungal.\\n\\nPooled safety data for the monolysine prodrug E1224 from Phase 1 and 2 trials\\nindicated that E1224 was generally well tolerated and exhibited a safety profile\\nquite similar to other azoles. Adverse events occurring in greater than 3% of E1224\\nrecipients, with a dose-dependent pattern and at rates higher than those observed\\nin placebo recipients included nausea, abnormalities in liver enzymes, dizziness,\\nanxiety, and contact dermatitis.\\n\\nSafety evaluations indicated relatively mild, transient, and asymptomatic increases\\nin liver enzymes — completely reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Phase 1\\ncardiac safety evaluations showed that E1224 administration did not result in QTc\\ninterval prolongation.\\n\\nExperimental data suggest a positive interaction between BZN and azole\\ncompounds for the treatment of Chagas disease. \\'®\\n\\nA Phase 1 drug-drug interaction trial was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics\\n(PK) and safety interaction of BNZ and E1224 co-administered daily for a total of\\n54 days (Day 4 to Day 15- E1224 multiple dose 400 mg loading dose once daily\\nfor 3 days, followed by maintenance dose 100mg once daily for 9 days (from Day 7\\nto Day 15); Day 9 BNZ single dose (2.5 mg/kg); and Day 12 toDay15 BNZ\\nmultiple dose (2.5 mg/kg twice daily)). The trial was conducted in Argentina and\\nwas concluded in early 2015, with enrolment of 28 healthy male volunteers. Both\\ncompounds were well tolerated, in monotherapy and combination. There were no\\ntreatment discontinuations or serious adverse events. Transient, minor, non-\\nconcomitant increase in bilirubin and liver transaminases occurred in 2 patients in\\na pattern not suggestive of drug effect. There was no interaction of RAV on BNZ\\nPK and the limited impact of BNZ on RAV PK, suggesting that co-administration of\\nRAV and BNZ may not require any E1224 dosing adaptation. The lack of clinically\\nrelevant safety findings provided support for follow-up evaluation of the two\\ncompounds in combination.\\n\\nIn conclusion, recent scientific advances have provided further impetus to develop\\nnew therapeutic approaches for CD using different doses and duration of BZN, as\\nwell as combinations directed at multiple therapeutic targets to improve treatment\\nresponse and tolerability and reduce the potential for development of resistance.\\n\\nThis project focuses on the proof-of-concept evaluation of improved treatment\\n\\nConfidential\\n\\nPage 11 of 87\\n\\n\\n\\n=== Page 13 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018.

In Latin America, 21 countries are endemic for CD with an\\nestimated 70 million people at risk of contracting the disease’. Estimates from the 1980s indicated\\nthat some 16 million to 18 million individuals were infected. In the 1990s, after a series of multinational\\ncontrol initiatives, estimates of the number of infected people were revised to 9.8 million in 2001. The\\nestimated burden of disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) declined from 2.7 million\\nin 1990 to 586,000 in 2001. Recent estimates from PAHO (2015) indicate about 6 million infected\\n\\npeople? and 29,925 new cases of vector transmission per year.\\n\\nThe current treatment for Chagas disease has significant limitations, including long treatment\\ndurations, safety and tolerability concerns and is currently limited to two nitro-heterocyclic drugs,\\nnifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN). BZN, a nitroimidazole introduced by Roche in 1971, is now\\nmarketed by Laboratorio Farmacéutico do Estado de Pernambuco S/A — LAFEPE and Laboratorio\\nELEA - Argentina. It is supplied in tablets strengths of 12.5 mg, 50 and 100 mg and administered\\ntwice daily at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight/day for adults and 5-10 mg/kg body weight/day for\\nchildren for 30-60 days. Notably, the current regimens with BZN for the treatment of adults with CD\\nlikely represent the maximum dosing case scenario in terms of dose, duration and schedule of\\n\\nadministration (Chagas expert meeting DNDi. January 2014. Geneva).\\n\\nLack of convincing and consistent data on efficacy and concerns about safety and tolerability\\nprofiles have limited the widespread implementation of BZN treatments. Despite being available since\\nthe early 70s, treatment recommendations vary significantly from country to country and the\\n\\ncomparative evidence-base with the current treatment regimens is limited.\\n\\nDoses and duration of treatment for CD has not been evaluated systematically. Current\\ntreatment regimens and dosing intervals have been derived from decades-old patient series and with\\nvery limited direct comparisons. Data from recently concluded trials suggest existing opportunities for\\n\\noptimisation of BZN treatment regimens.\\n\\nFrom 2011 to 2013, a DNDi-sponsored Phase 2, proof-of-concept clinical trial on E1224 and\\nBZN in adults with chronic indeterminate CD was conducted in Bolivia assessing different dosing\\nregimen of E1224 given for 4 to 8 weeks and benznidazole standard regimen against placebo. The\\ntrial provided clear efficacy and safety information on the two compounds to support further clinical\\ndevelopment and access’. After one week of treatment, mean qPCR repeated measures analyses\\nshowed a significant difference in parasite load vs. placebo in all treatment arms. All BZN-treated\\npatients had cleared parasite DNA after 2 weeks of treatment. At end-of treatment (EOT, Day 65),\\nE1224 was found to be efficacious in clearing T. cruzi parasites when compared to placebo. Six\\nmonths after treatment, 22-33% of patients receiving E1224 low dose and short duration and 60% of\\nthose receving high dose E1224 sustained parasite clearance compared with 95.6% of patients\\ntreated with BZN Of note, the large majority of treatment failures were identified up to 6 month follow-\\n\\nup visit.\\n\\nConfidential Page 23 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 25 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018. Version 5.0.\\n\\nAlthough E1224 was found to have limited efficacy as a single-treatment agent, it holds\\npromise for use in combination with existing drugs, since it showed strong positive activity during\\n\\ntreatment, with a third of patients having a sustained treatment response at the higher dose.\\n\\nSafety analyses showed that the most common BZN related AEs were nausea (20%),\\ndermatologic AEs (11.1%), hypersensitivity reactions (24.4%), headache (24.4%), and neuropathy\\n(11.1%), with a time-course pattern for development of treatment emergent adverse events. Gastro-\\nintestinal disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions were the first to occur, followed by liver enzyme\\nabnormalities, while most cases of neuropathy occurred after 30 days of treatment. Around 9% of\\npatients in the BZN arm had elevated transaminases and hypersensitivity reactions leading to\\ntreatment discontinuation. In the E1224 treatment groups, there was a dose-dependent increase in\\nAEs, including headache (24.4%), nausea (15.6%) and liver enzyme elevations (ALT (22.2%) and\\nAST (17.8%).\\n\\nThese data suggest that BZN is rapidly effective, however there is both an efficacy gap with\\nabout 80% sustained response at 12 months and a tolerability gap, with a proportion of patients (10-\\n20%) who do not complete treatment in conditions of use, the majority due to adverse drug reactions\\n\\n(ADRs) and the long treatment duration (see Figure 1).\\n\\nFigure 1: Current treatment for Chagas with BNZ\\n\\n00% 1\\nTOLERABILITY GAP\\n\\n80%\\n\\nTolerability\\ndV9 AOVOIdsa\\n\\nEfficacy 80% 100%\\n\\nBetween April 2008 and November 2010 a prospective population-pharmacokinetics cohort\\ntrialt conducted at the Parasitology and Chagas Service, Buenos Aires Children’s Hospital “R\\nGutierrez” enrolled 40 children between 2 and 12 years of age with CD. The observed BZN plasma\\nconcentrations in children were significantly lower than those previously reported in adults (treated\\nwith comparable mg/kg doses), possibly due to a higher weight-corrected clearance rate (CL/F) in\\nsmaller children. The lower blood concentrations were nevertheless associated to parasite clearance\\nin all children, measured by PCR. Unlike adults, children had few adverse reactions to the drug,\\nsuggesting that there may be a direct correlation between drug concentrations and incidence of ADRs.\\nA second trial, sponsored by DNDi, testing the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship using\\nthe 12.5mg new paediatric dosage form and enrolling a total of 81 children from birth to 12 years of\\n\\nage in multiple paediatric centres in Argentina (PED-CHAGAS network), confirmed this pattern®.\\n\\nRecent population PK data in adults further characterized BNZ PK in adults with chronic\\n\\nChagas disease and suggested that the current BZN dosing regimen (2.5 mg/kg/12 h) may lead to\\n\\nConfidential Page 24 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 26 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018.

Dosing simulations suggested that a BNZ dose of 2.5\\nmg/kg/24 h would adequately keep BNZ trough plasma concentrations within the recommended target\\nrange for the majority of patients®. There are also opportunities for evaluation of fixed dose regimens\\nfor adult dosing, rather than mg/kg calculations, with increased ease-of-use and potential for improved\\n\\ncompliance in scaling up treatment of CD.\\n\\nLikewise, several controlled observational trials with BZN, 5 mg/kg/day for 30 or 60 days\\nhave shown a reduction in the progression of heart disease serological and sero-negative conversion\\nup to 60% in children and 30% in adults?®*.°.1112.13_ Different publications showed anti-parasitic\\n\\nefficacy of treatment regimens with 30 and 60 days\"*® and of incomplete treatment of 10 days\"®.\\n\\nAdditional experimental data suggest other opportunities for alternative dosing regimens of\\nBZN. Bustamante et a/. showed that intermittent BZN administration had similar parasitological cure\\nrates to standard treatment, in a stringent murine model of chronic CD ‘”. A pilot follow-up trial was\\nconducted in Argentina by Viotti, Sosa-Estani, and colleagues to evaluate a BZN treatment regimen\\nwith intermittent doses of 5 mg/kg/day, taken at 5-day intervals, during 60 days in 17 adult patients\\nwith chronic CD. Preliminary results show a high proportion of end of treatment clearance of\\n\\nparasitemia with this regimen, in line with historical data on standard BZN treatment.\\n\\nTaking into consideration these results, two approaches for Chagas treatment optimization\\nare to be pursued (Figure 2): 1) Changing current adult dosing regimen for BNZ to reduce exposure\\nand improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy; and, 2) Development of a combination therapy to\\nimprove efficacy while maintaining or improving tolerability. The former does not address the existing\\nefficacy gap. Combination therapy aims to address the efficacy gap and may or may not address\\n\\ntolerability gap.\\n\\nFigure 2: Options for improving current treatment\\n\\nDe nREOUCEDIBNZ um\\n\\nREGIMENS\\nfy _ {improve tolerabilitv)\\n\\n2\\nhe\\n\\nTolerability\\n\\nEfficacy 80% 100%\\n\\nThe causative agent of CD, T. cruzi, has been called the “cruzi complex” because of the\\nconsiderable genetic polymorphism observed between parasite populations.

Drug susceptibility varies\\nwidely depending upon direct typing units (DTUs), geographic location, host factors, and prior therapy\\n\\nused.\\n\\nTreatment of virtually every infectious disease begins with empiric therapy intended to cover\\nthe broadest possible spectrum of pathogens likely to cause the infection. Therapy is then narrowed\\n\\nonce the etiologic pathogen is identified and the drug susceptibility pattern is determined.\\n\\nIn routine treatment of chronic indeterminate CD, identification of the specific etiologic\\npathogen is almost never possible. Also, there is evidence that more than one parasite lineage can\\n\\ncause an infection in a single patient.\\n\\nCombination therapy is a well-recognized treatment modality in many disease settings,\\nincluding cancer, cardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases. Several infectious diseases. such\\nas tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, and AIDS, only came under control and were effectively treated only\\n\\nafter introduction of combinations of drugs that utilize different mechanisms of action.\\n\\nE1224 is a water-soluble monolysine salt form of the ravuconazole (RAV) pro-drug (which is\\na phosphonooxymethyl ether derivative of RAV). It is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal. RAV was\\nevaluated extensively in animal models and in human trials including Phase 2 safety and efficacy\\ntrials in oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis and onychomycosis, and for prevention of\\n\\ninvasive fungal infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.\\n\\nE1224 is rapidly converted to RAV in vivo: data from both preclinical and clinical evaluations\\nof RAV are therefore considered relevant to E1224. E1224 is available as oral formulations (100\\ncapsules). It has completed general toxicology and safety pharmacology trials, as well as five Phase\\n1 clinical trials: ascending, single and multiple loading and maintenance dose, bioavailability, and\\nfood-effect trial; ascending, multiple loading and maintenance dose trial of E1224 administered\\nintravenously over 14 days; effect of E1224 on cytochrome P450 enzymes; and cardiac\\n\\nsafety/thorough QTc trial.\\n\\nPharmacokinetic trials showed that E1224 is rapidly converted to RAV with a peak\\nconcentration at 2.5 to 6 hours post-dose with a long terminal half-life of 7.7 to 10.5 days. RAV\\naccumulated over time (AUC on Day 1 < Day 7 and 14). With a loading and maintenance dose\\nstrategy, a steady state level at desired peak concentrations of RAV can be achieved within 7 days\\n\\nof initial dosing.\\n\\nSafety evaluations indicated relatively mild, transient, and asymptomatic increases in liver\\nenzymes — completely reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Phase 1 cardiac safety evaluations\\nshowed that E1224 administration did not result in QTc interval prolongation. Mean QTcF interval was\\nshortened compared to baseline, with peak effect on QTc interval at 1 and 1.5 hours post-dosing and\\nmean change from baseline of -16.9 to -19.4 msec. QT remained within normal limits and there was\\nno dose-response relationship to these changes at steady-state. Findings resolved spontaneously by\\n\\n4 hours after dosing.

E1224 was generally\\nwell tolerated, with the exception of modest increases in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and alkaline\\n\\nphosphatase).\\n\\nThe results of a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, a 26-week rat toxicity (tox)\\n\\nstudy, and a 39-week toxicology study in monkeys have shown the following results:\\n\\n@ In the pre- and postnatal development study in rats, the no-observable-adverse-effect\\nlevel (NOAEL) for FO maternal general toxicity and reproductive function was 27.4 mg/kg. The NOAEL\\nfor F1 development was 8.2 mg/kg. The NOAEL for F1 reproductive function and F2 embryo\\ndevelopment was 109.4 mg/kg.\\n\\n@ Results from the 26-week rat tox study (dosed at 0, 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day) revealed\\nno death or moribundity related to the test article.

There were increased adrenal weights in\\nfemales at =30 mg/kg, increased adrenal vacuolation of cortical cells in both sexes at =30 mg/kg,\\nand decreased triglycerides in males at 60 mg/kg. Based on these results, the NOAEL was considered\\n\\nto be 10 mg/kg.\\n\\n@ Results from the 39-week toxicity study in monkeys with ravuconazole doses of 1 to 30\\nmg/kg revealed no death or moribundity related to the test article. No changes were observed in\\nclinical signs or food consumption, though one male monkey in the 30 mg/kg dose group\\ndemonstrated gradual body weight decrease throughout the dosing period (-11%, vs pre-dosing).\\nThere were no changes in ophthalmoscopy, ECG, urinalysis, or hematology measurements. Gross\\nfindings showed enlarged liver and adrenals. The histopathological changes in liver appeared to be\\nrelated to adaptive hepatocellular hypertrophy. These findings were comparable to those observed in\\nthe previous 4- and 13-week toxicity studies at doses of 5 and 30 mg/kg. These were adaptive\\nchanges related to hepatic enzyme induction, and no evidence of progression or increased severity\\nwas observed after 39 weeks of administration. In the adrenal glands, increased vacuolation of the\\ncortical cells in males at 30 mg/kg and females at 5 and 30 mg/kg; this was an expected class effect\\nof azoles. A 3- to 4-fold increase in triglycerides was noted in the 30 mg/kg dose male monkeys\\ncompared to control.

There was no interaction of RAV on\\nBNZ PK and the limited impact of BNZ on RAV PK, suggesting that co-administration of RAV and\\nBNZ may not require any E1224 dosing adaptation. The lack of clinically relevant safety findings\\n\\nprovided support for follow-up evaluation of the two compounds in combination.\\n\\nIn conclusion, recent scientific advances have provided further impetus to develop new\\ntherapeutic approaches for CD using different doses and duration of BZN, as well as combinations\\ndirected at multiple therapeutic targets to improve treatment response and tolerability and reduce the\\n\\npotential for development of resistance.\\n\\nThis project focuses on the proof-of-concept evaluation of improved treatment regimens of\\nBZN, with the assessment of new BZN-sparing regimens in monotherapy and in combination with\\nE1224.\\n\\n2.

Version 5.0.\\n\\nPatient recruitment is expected to occur within 10 months of recruitment initiation.\\nTherefore, the timeline of First Patient In (FPI) and Last Patient Out (LPO) is 22 months. However,\\n\\nthe total trial duration is estimated to be 28 months, from start-up phase to final trial report.\\n\\n3.3. Rationale of trial design\\n\\nThe selection of a placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial design was based on the\\nrequirements for well-controlled proof-of-concept, efficacy and safety data for Benznidazole and\\n\\nBeznnidazole/E1224 for this therapeutic indication.\\n\\nThe choice of the CD target population was largely driven by the unmet medical need for\\na new, safe and effective treatment for chronic indeterminate CD. Adults with chronic\\nindeterminate CD are recognized as the population with the most urgent requirements for the\\ndevelopment of new treatments. Drugs employed in children, with acute and early chronic CD\\nare more often efficacious and better tolerated, with less than 10% of patients presenting serious\\n\\nadverse events.\\n\\nMoreover, with a decreasing incidence and existing patterns of disease presentation, the\\nhighest disease burden is found in patients in the chronic indeterminate phase of the disease.\\nCD is seldom diagnosed in the acute phase, with circulating parasites identifiable by optical\\nmicroscopy, with the exception of congenital cases, immunosuppressed patients and the small\\nclusters of oral transmission. Carrying out rigorous clinical trials in any of these populations would\\npresent ethical and logistical challenges (in light of high response rates to benznidazole in\\ncongenital disease), confounding elements (due to the severity of disease and need for frequent\\nconcomitant medications in the case of immunosuppressed patients) and feasibility issues (due\\nto the small numbers and dispersed nature of most clusters of oral transmission in the Amazon\\n\\nregion).\\n\\nThe efficacy of this indication will be assessed through sustained parasitological response\\nover six months measured by serial negative qualitative PCRs as the primary endpoint. Clinical\\nCD related events occur at a low incidence in this population and would thus require very large\\nclinical trials to assess incidence changes and serological endpoints would require several years\\nto decades in chronic CD. Recently concluded clinical trials provide support for the selected\\n\\nendpoint and timelines for assessment in proof-of-concept.\\n\\nThe secondary endpoints will assess the sustained parasitemia at 12 months and the time\\nto clearance of parasitemia by serial negative qualitative PCR results, comparing each of the six\\ndosing regimens relative to placebo, notably assessment of parasite load over time, conventional\\nand non-conventional serology. Parasite clearance data will be correlated with pharmacokinetic\\n\\nparameters.\\n\\nThe evaluation of cure is considered to be the most complex aspect of treatment\\nassessment in CD. Parasitological cure is difficult to interpret and its evaluation is challenging in\\n\\nConfidential Page 32 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 34 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018. Version 5.0.\\n\\nlight of the need for total elimination of parasites, not only from the blood but also from tissues\\nwhere it is not measurable. Assessment of parasitological cure requires long-term follow-up\\nbecause of the pathogenesis and hysteresis of the disease, the characteristics of the parasite,\\nthe host response times, and the consequent clinical manifestations. Such changes occur over\\n\\nlong periods of time.\\n\\nA negative direct blood smear at the end of treatment is generally accepted as evidence\\nof a favorable response in acute CD patients. In chronic disease, serial hemocultures,\\nxenodiagnosis, or PCR have been used to support the serological assessment, and a positive\\nparasitological diagnostic test result indicates treatment failure. Hemoculture and xenodiagnosis\\nare techniques that require proper resources/infrastructure and very skillful and experienced\\npersonnel to adequately perform them. With regard to conventional serology, for chronic\\nindeterminate CD patients, seroconversion to negative would occur after 5 to 10 years (although\\ncases with a longer period for conversion to negative have been described). Therefore, for the\\npurposes of clinical development and proof-of-concept, it has been proposed that qualitative and\\nquantitative PCR parasitological tests be used as markers for efficacy in clinical trials of chronic\\n\\nindeterminate CD.\\n\\nImportant considerations have included the significant variability in the clinical sensitivity\\nand specificity of PCR tests observed in early published trials, with differences seen across all\\nphases of the disease and across a number of techniques in use that require standardization. In\\nparticular, there has been concern regarding the sensitivity of PCR in chronic CD due to low\\nlevels of circulating parasites and natural fluctuations in parasitemia. In a recent comparison of\\ntwo diagnostic techniques in patients with chronic CD, PCR had high specificity (100%) and\\nmoderate sensitivity (70% to 75%).\\n\\nThe latest PCR trials have shown higher sensitivity, with a broad dynamic range for PCR\\nuse allowing direct measurements in cases with high parasitic loads such as in\\nimmunosuppressed CD patients and congenitally infected newborns, as well as in cases with low\\nparasitic loads, such as patients in the chronic indeterminate phase or who are receiving\\n\\nantiparasitic treatment.\\n\\nAn important advance in recent years has been the trial sponsored by UNICEF/UNDP/\\nWorld Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) for\\nthe standardization and laboratory validation of qualitative PCR testing for T. cruzi. Standardized\\nprocedures for the qualitative assessment of PCR (standard and real-time) testing with higher\\nanalytical sensitivity and specificity, reproducibility, and low levels of intra- and inter-assay\\n\\nvariation and high levels of accuracy have been selected.\\n\\nDuring expert panel discussions and with support from recent data on DNDi sponsored\\ntrials, there is consensus on the value of using serial, sequential blood collections for qualitative\\nand quantitative PCR assays in order to increase PCR test sensitivity and evaluate durability of\\n\\nresponse. The proposed trial will incorporate the standardized and optimized procedures for\\n\\nConfidential Page 33 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 35 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018. Version 5.0.\\n\\nPCR testing. In particular, it would focus on the real-time PCR technique described by Duffy et al\\nand implemented in the recent E1224 Phase 2 clinical trial.\\n\\nAdditionally, the validation of qPCR methods of T.cruzi DNA in human blood samples are\\nthe object of international efforts aiming to provide an accurate biomarker for diagnosis and\\n\\ntreatment monitoring for patients with CD.\\n\\nA recent article published by Ramirez, JC et al, described an international trial performed\\nby 26 experienced PCR laboratories from 14 countries to assess the performance of duplex\\nquantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) strategies on the basis of TaqMan probes for detection and\\nquantification of parasitic loads in peripheral blood samples from CD patients. Two methods were\\nstudied: Satellite DNA (SatDNA) qPCR and kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) qPCR. Both methods were\\nchallenged against 156 blood samples provided by the participant laboratories, including samples\\nfrom acute and chronic patients with varied clinical findings, infected by oral route or vectorial\\ntransmission. Analyses of clinical samples revealed a high concordance in terms of sensitivity\\nand parasitic loads determined by both SatDNA and kDNA qPCRs. All the laboratories\\nparticipants of this clinical trial participated in this qPCR validation trial.The current trial will\\nobtain information on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alternative regimens of\\nBenznidazole and the combination of Benznidazole and E1224 in CD to inform further clinical\\ndevelopment. Sampling for population pharmacokinetic analysis of drug concentrations over time\\nwill be obtained in the present trial, and correlation is planned of pharmacokinetic parameters\\n\\nwith different efficacy and safety outcomes.\\n\\nThe rationale for the selection of the doses and regimens are based on the following\\n\\ncriteria:\\nGroup Objective Justification / comment\\n1 BZN STD Reference Need to document reference treatment efficacy with\\nRegimen ELEA product on a fixed daily dose.\\n300 mg - 8\\nwks\\n2 Improving Animal data show that standard BZN dose with a\\nBZN 300 mg - safety & 25% reduction in treatment duration showed\\n4 wks maintaining identical efficacy.

Storage\\n\\nStability trials performed by Eisai showed that E1224 100-mg capsules were stable at\\n30°C/75% RH for 12 months and 40°C/75% RH for 6 months. Therefore, provisional shelf life\\nfor E1224 100-mg capsules is 24 months at controlled room temperature. The shelf life of the\\n\\n100-mg capsules will be extended based on the results of future stability data.\\nBZN tablets are stable at room temperature (15 — 30° C).\\n\\nTherefore, the trial drug can be shipped at normal conditions and must be kept at\\nroom temperatures, at 30°C. The trial drugs must be kept in a locked room at each of the trial\\n\\nsites, with restricted access only by the authorized trial personnel and/or pharmacist.\\n\\nSite storage conditions and temperature must be monitored by the site personnel for\\nadherence to product specifications. Records must be done at least once daily and kept in the\\n\\ninvestigator trial file or in the pharmacy file.\\n\\n7.6. Blinding and procedures for unblinding\\nThis is a double-blinded trial. Patients, investigators and sponsor staff directly\\ninvolved with the clinical trial will not be aware of the treatment allocation and randomization\\n\\nlist. Double-blinding will be adopted for all trial arms and the placebo arm.\\n\\nPrimary efficacy analyses will be performed when all patients complete 6 months\\nfollow-up visit. Analyses of results will be used to guide planning of a follow-up Phase 3 clinical\\nstudy. Analysis is to be performed by an independent, external statistician. In order to allow\\nadministrative decisions, the results of the primary endpoint will be disclosed unblinded (by\\ntreatment arm) to the Joint Development Committee. No individual patient data will be shared\\n\\nwith the Committee. In addition, data is to be shared with the Data Monitoring Committee.\\n\\nThe Joint Development Committee is composed of the DNDi Project Leader (DNDi\\nHead of Chagas Program or designated person), DNDi Medical Director, and members from\\nthe Eisai team. On occasions the JDC meetings are attended by other members of staff from\\nthese organisations. Under no circumstances will, the Principal Investigator, trial site staff and\\nstudy personnel from the Sponsor managing the trial have access to the results of the primary\\nefficacy analysis prior to the end of the study. They will remain unequivocally blinded until\\ncompletion of 12 months follow-up and final database lock. The study statisticians will not have\\n\\naccess to unblinded data before conduct of the analyses at the end of the study.\\n\\nConfidential Page 48 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 50 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018.

The specific procedures will be detailed in the IRS guideline.\\n\\nThe treatment groups will be allocated on Day 1 based on a balanced block randomization.\\n\\nEach patient will be assigned with an identification code that will correspond to the\\ntrial kit number allocated to the patient. The label will indicate the trial number and number of\\n\\nthe kit, but will not indicate the treatment designation.\\n\\nAll objective measurements in this trial (in terms of efficacy and safety) will be\\nperformed blinded to the treatment allocation. EKGs will be read centrally and without\\nknowledge of the patient’s treatment group. PCR and laboratory information will be provided\\n\\ncoded, without the name of the patient to allow blinding during sample processing and analysis.\\n\\nCode breaking will be performed via the IRS. The investigator or person designated\\n\\nmust contact the IRS and do the specific procedure as described in the IRS manual.\\n\\nBreaking the code of any trial patient should only be performed by the investigator or\\nby an authorized person if absolutely necessary to find out the treatment administered. The\\nbreaking of the code can only be performed when the result of a life threatening medical\\nemergency may depend on the knowledge of the treatment the received by the patient. The\\nDNDi clinical trial manager or the trial monitor must be immediately informed about the need\\nof unblinding, ideally before doing so. An emergency code-break form will be filled out with\\ninformation on patient number, date of code-break, identification and signature of person\\nbreaking the code, identification of person requesting the code break, reasons for breaking the\\n\\ncode and investigator\\'s signature.\\n\\nA Serious Adverse Event form should also be filled out if the reason for code-breaking\\n\\nmeets the criteria.\\n\\nIn addition, there will be situations whereby unblinding may not necessarily justify\\npatient withdrawal from the trial. In such cases, these patients should also continue with trial\\n\\nvisits and assessments as planned.\\n\\n7.7. Concomitant treatment\\n\\nPatients may receive concomitant therapy for medical occurrences during the course\\nof the trial. However, specific drugs that interact with the trial drugs, have the potential to\\nshorten the QT interval, elevate liver enzymes, are either sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and/or\\nextensively metabolized by CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic range, are\\nimmunosuppressants or are known to have activity against T. cruzi may not be taken during\\nthe treatment phase of the trial or up to the 4M visit. These specific drugs are listed in the\\n\\nAppendix 2.\\n\\nConfidential Page 49 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 51 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018.

The use of any oral, implanted, or injectable\\ncontraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device with a\\nhormonal component should be registered as concomitant treatment. Additionally, as\\naddressed in section 7.6.8, women will be required to add an additional method, such as\\n\\nbarrier.\\n\\nAll concomitant medications taken by the patient during the trial, from the date of\\nsignature of the informed consent until the last follow up visit, will be recorded in the appropriate\\n\\nsection of the Case Record Form.\\n\\n8.

After patient eligibility is confirmed, randomization will occur and patient will receive\\n\\nthe first dose of medication at the clinic. On day 1, vital signs, EKG (1 examination) and PK\\n\\nsampling will also be performed after treatment administration. DO and D1 may be at the same\\n\\nday if all results are available for patient’s eligibility assessment. In this case, site should pay\\n\\nattention to perform examinations pre and post-dose accordingly (see Schedule of Events in\\n\\nsection 5).\\n\\nConfidential Page 52 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 54 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018.

If any AE\\noccurs, the patient will receive medical assistance, and the event will be recorded in the\\n\\nappropriate CRF.\\n\\n8.3. Assessment of Efficacy\\n\\nEfficacy of trial treatment will be assessed by comparing the parasitological response,\\ndetermined by serial qualitative PCR (3 negative PCR results to be collected in the same day)\\nassessed at EOT and sustained parasitological clearance until 6 months of follow-up. Follow-\\n\\nup will be continued until 12 months for complementary assessment of response.\\n\\nFor the assessment of efficacy, the EOT of each treatment arm will be defined accordingly\\nto its corresponding duration. For efficacy assessments, the EOT of each treatment arm will\\nbe defined in accordance to the duration of the treatment regimen. Sustained response will be\\nassessed in all treatment arms using the same number of PCR samples (i.e., EOT; 12 weeks;\\n\\n4, and 6 months). The primary efficacy outcome is evaluated until 6 months of follow-up.\\n\\nAs this is a double-blind trial, this will not interfere on the schedule of events, since all\\n\\npatients will take all samples planned at each visit.\\n\\nIn addition, a qualitative, quantitative, and multi-criteria efficacy assessment of\\nBenznidazole and BZN/E1224 will be performed, correlating incidence of and time to\\nparasitological clearance with changes in T. cruzi serology and with safety and PK parameters,\\n\\nas described in the following sections.\\n\\n8.3.1.

Results will be expressed qualitatively for the assessment of the primary efficacy\\n\\nendpoint and quantitatively for secondary analyses of parasite load.\\n\\nIn order to guarantee the quality, integrity and standardization of the qPCR procedures\\n\\nbetween the two laboratories, Quality Assurance mechanisms were developed such as:\\n\\nReproducibility evaluation: Blind analysis of 10% of samples from the trial, taken\\nrandomly and sent to two laboratories of molecular biology quarterly. The results of these\\nsamples will be re-sent to an independent laboratory in a pre-established time to a DNDi ad-\\nhoc committee for analysis of concordance compared to the results obtained from the two\\n\\nlaboratories participating in the trial.\\n\\nQualitative concordance: Detectable or undetectable values of each sample following\\nthe reporting criteria according to pre-established standardized analysis PCR evaluation\\n\\nprocess. It is expected to achieve 2 0.75 kappa index for concordance of all samples analyzed.\\nQuantitative concordance:\\n\\nThe degree of concordance must match the coefficient of variation of the method\\naccording to the parasitic load. The limit of quantification of the method was estimated as 1,531\\nCL Brener par. eq./mL GEB (equivalent to 1.85 log10 par. eq./10 mL). By definition this limit\\nwas chosen to present a coefficient of variation of 20% of the results expressed in logarithm,\\nas recommended by the document EP17-A (NCCLS, 2004) from the precision calculation of\\nthe method published in Duffy et al, 2012. Thus, values less than 1.85 log par.eq /10 mL are\\nnot quantifiable, .values 2 log par/10 mL have a coefficient of variation of 6% and values 4 log\\npar/ 10 mL show a coefficient of variation of 1.72%. The parasite load corresponding to the CV\\n\\nof each sample can be estimated by Sigma Plot (SPSS, Chicago, IL).\\n\\nPCR samples taken at different moments during the treatment period will allow a\\ncomparative assessment of the time to clearance of parasitemia for each of the treatment\\nregimens versus that of placebo. Sustained parasitological clearance will be evaluated at EOT\\n\\nuntil 6 months follow-up visit as primary endpoint, and until 12 months as secondary endpoint.\\n\\nThe real-time PCR assays will allow assessment of change in parasite load over time\\nand of comparative reduction in parasite load values at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, and at 4, 6,\\nand 12 months follow-up.

Evaluation of hematology and\\nblood chemistry values, regular measurement of vital signs and physical examinations will be\\n\\nmade at each scheduled follow-up visit, as summarized in section 5.\\n\\nCardiac Safety:\\n\\ne EKGs will be performed at selected trial visits (Days 1, 2, 3 and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and\\n4 months) in order to identify possible electrocardiographic abnormalities. If clinically\\nsignificant abnormalities are judged by the investigators at these visits, unscheduled EKG\\n\\nshould be performed until normalization.\\n\\ne Patients will be re-dosed only following on-site physician review of available EKGs (central\\nreading). Specific criteria for treatment discontinuation are described in Section 9 of the\\n\\ntrial protocol.\\n\\ne Any patient with a QTc, post dosing <310 msec or with a QTc, post dosing <350 msec\\naccompanied of cardiac symptoms, shall be withdrawn (Specific criteria for treatment\\ndiscontinuation are described in sections 9.1 and 9.2). In those cases, a full cardiac\\n\\nassessment should be performed, including EKG, Echocardiogram and Holter.\\n\\ne Any patient with a delta QTc >60 msec post dosing will have the trial medication\\npermanently interrupted and will follow the standard trial schedule. For the cases where\\nin addition to the delta QTc >60 msec post-dosing, cardiac symptoms are present, an\\n\\nEKG should be performed at unscheduled visits.\\n\\nConfidential Page 56 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 58 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018.

Adverse Event reporting requirements\\nInformation on adverse events must be evaluated by a physician. Each adverse event\\nis to be classified by the investigator as serious or non-serious. This classification will\\n\\ndetermine the reporting procedure for the event.\\n\\nAll serious adverse events (SAE) are to be reported immediately (within 24 hours of\\nawareness of the SAE by the investigator) to an email to be informed at Study Manual in copy\\nto the DNDi clinical trial manager, using the SAE report form. This includes a description of\\nthe event, onset date and type, duration, severity, relationship to trial drug, outcome, measures\\ntaken and all other relevant clinical and laboratory data. The initial report is to be followed by\\nsubmission of additional information (follow-up SAE form) as it becomes available. Any follow-\\n\\nup reports should be submitted as soon as possible and if possible within 5 working days.\\n\\nSerious adverse events should also be reported on the clinical trial adverse event case\\nreport form (CRF). It should be noted that the form for reporting of SAE (SAE form) is not the\\nsame as the adverse event section of the CRF. Whereas the same data are collected, the two\\nforms must be completed in a consistent manner, and the same medical terminology should\\n\\nbe used. Any other additional reporting requirement will be addressed in the trial manual.\\n\\nAdverse Events of Special Interest shall be informed to the Sponsor in an expedited\\nmanner within same timelines (irrespective of the grade of the AES) as required for SAEs, but\\nusing the AESI form. If AESI meet any seriousness criteria (8.6.2), they should then comply\\n\\nfor associated safety reporting requirements and be reported on the SAE form.\\n\\nNon-serious adverse events are to be reported in the CRF. In the CRF, a given adverse\\nevent will be recorded only one time per patient, and the severity recorded will be the maximum\\nlevel reached. If several distinct episodes of the same condition occur, their number will be\\nrecorded in the CRF.\\n\\nConfidential Page 63 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 65 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018.

Grading of Adverse Event severity\\n\\nSeverity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an AE. The severity for an AE\\nshould be graded using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for\\nAdverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.03). In case of AEs that are not described in the CTCAE v\\n4.03, the investigator will use the terminology MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the\\n\\nmaximum severity of the adverse event as follows:\\n\\nMILD Does not interfere with patient\\'s usual functions\\nMODERATE Interferes to some extent with patient\\'s usual functions\\nSEVERE Interferes significantly with patient\\'s usual functions\\n\\nThis information on AE grading will be entered in the adverse event section of the CRF.\\n\\nIt is to be noted the distinction between severity and seriousness of adverse events. A\\n\\nsevere adverse event is not necessarily a serious event.\\n\\n8.6.8. Adverse Event causality assessment\\n\\nFor both serious and non-serious adverse events, the investigator is required to assess\\nthe potential relationship between the adverse event and the trial drug, i.e. to determine\\nwhether there exists a reasonable possibility that the trial drug caused or contributed to the\\n\\nadverse event.\\n\\nTo help investigators with the decision binary tree in the evaluation of causality, the\\nCIOMS VI group recommends that investigators be asked to consider the following before\\n\\nreaching a decision:\\n\\ne Medical history\\n\\ne Lack of efficacy/worsening of existing condition\\n\\ne Trial medications\\n\\ne Other medications (concomitant or previous)\\n\\ne Withdrawal of trial medication, especially following trial discontinuation/end of\\ntrial medication\\n\\ne Erroneous treatment with trial medication (or concomitant)\\n\\ne Protocol related procedure\\n\\nConfidential Page 64 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 66 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018. Version 5.0.\\n\\nThe relationship of an AE to investigational treatment is assessed and determined by\\nthe investigator after careful consideration of the event in terms of biological plausibility,\\npossible unrelated causes, any pre-existing medical conditions or concomitant medications,\\ntemporal relationship between administration of investigational treatment and the onset (or\\n\\nworsening) of the event, and known patterns of response to trial medications in general.\\n\\nThe causality assessment of an AE to the investigational medicinal product will be rated\\n\\nas follows:\\ne Not related: There is no reasonable possibility of causal relationship.\\n\\ne Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between\\nan adverse event and an investigational medicinal product. This means that there\\n\\nare facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.\\n\\nThe decision to suspend, and resume treatment or to permanently interrupt treatment\\ndue to an adverse event will be left to the trial clinician in charge.The clinician should take in\\nconsideration the Assessment of Safety defined for this protocol (section 8.5) and the Rules\\n\\nfor permanently interrupting trial treatment (section 9.2).\\n\\n8.6.9. Exposure in utero\\n\\nIn this trial, women of reproductive age must have a negative serum pregnancy test at\\nscreening, must not be breastfeeding, and must use a double barrier method of contraception\\nto avoid exposure to the study drugs during pregnancy throughout the clinical trial and up for\\n3 months after completion of the trial, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized\\nespecially during exposure to treatment and until complete elimination. Women who are using\\noral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an\\nintrauterine device with a hormonal component are required to use an additional barrier\\n\\nmethod of contraception for the time period specified.\\n\\nIn addition to the serum pregnancy tests performed at screening and Day 0, an\\n\\nadditional pregnancy test will be carried out at week 10, and at 6 and 12 months follow-up visit.\\n\\nIf any trial subject becomes or is found to be pregnant while receiving any of the study\\ntreatment drugs (or during study post-treatment follow-up period + 3 months), the medication\\nmust be interrupted and investigator must submit the event on a ‘Clinical Study Pregnancy\\nReport Form’ together with the first day of last menstruation period and the expected date of\\nbirth. This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred. The\\n\\ninformation submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery.\\n\\nConfidential Page 65 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 67 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018.

The investigator will provide\\n\\npregnancy outcome information in a ‘Clinical Study Pregnancy Outcome Report Form’.\\n\\nNote: A pregnancy is not an SAE. Any unfavorable outcome meeting a seriousness criterion,\\ni.e., in the case of unfavorable pregnancy outcome (miscarriage, stillbirth), birth defect occurs\\nor congenital abnormality shall be reported using the SAE form (in addition to the Pregnancy\\n\\nOutcome Form).\\n\\nIn the case of a live birth, a pediatrician should assess the infant at the time of birth and submit\\na Child Surveillance form. Newborns of study subjects exposed to study drugs during\\n\\npregnancy will be followed up until the age of 2 years.\\n\\nBecause of the risk of development of lenticular opacity, (cataract) found in animal studies with\\nE1224, an ophthalmologist will also assess the infant of study subjects exposed to study drugs\\nduring pregnancy from the time of birth until the child reaches 24 months of age. The principal\\ninvestigator must gather information on the child\\'s health status from birth to 24 months of age\\nby the child\\'s treating physicians (pediatrician, ophthalmologist). Investigator must inform and\\nadvise the mother to ensure the monitoring of the child\\'s health status, as well as complete the\\nsafety information of the child\\'s health status in the corresponding form (Child Surveillance\\n\\nForm).\\n\\n8.6.10. Adverse event follow-up\\nAll adverse events should be followed until they are resolved or the investigator\\nassesses them as chronic or stable or the patient participation in the trial ends (i.e., until a final\\n\\nreport is completed for that patient).\\n\\nIn addition, all serious adverse events and those non-serious events assessed by the\\ninvestigator as possibly related to the investigational drug must continue to be followed even\\nafter the patient participation in the trial is over.

Rules in case of treatment suspension or temporarily interruption\\n\\nTreatment discontinuation does not imply withdrawal from the trial. In such cases, the\\ntreatment might be discontinued for a few days; therefore, the treatment will be considered\\nincomplete or delayed. Treatment can be resumed, according to the assessment of the trial\\ninvestigator in charge of the patient. Please check the instructions for safety assessment and\\nfollow-up as per section 8.5. These patients should continue with trial visits and assessments\\nas planned, but the reasons for treatment discontinuation must be recorded in the appropriate\\n\\nsource documentation and CRF.\\n\\n9.2.

Efficacy Analysis\\nThe primary efficacy endpoint is parasitological response, defined as sustained\\nparasitological clearance until6 months of follow-up. It is determined by serial qualitative PCR\\n\\nresults (3 negative PCR results to be collected in the same day).\\n\\nHypothesis: Benznidazole or Benznidazole/E1124 improved regimens treatment\\nleads to a statistically significant better sustained parasitological clearance rate at 6 months of\\n\\nfollow-up than placebo in patients with chronic indeterminate CD.\\n\\nThe primary analysis will be the comparison of the sustained parasitological clearance\\nof each treatment arm versus that of the placebo arm. Six main final comparisons will be\\nperformed. Hochberg procedure will be used to keep the global type | error at the 5% level and\\ncope with the multiplicity issue. With sustained clearance of parasitemia as the parameter of\\ninterest, a comparison with placebo will be carried out. An alpha adjustment to 0.025 is\\n\\nconsidered for the interim analyses to account for potential Type | inflation.\\n\\nPrimary efficacy analyses will be performed when all patients complete 6 months\\nfollow-up visit. Analyses of results will be used to guide planning of a follow-up Phase 3 clinical\\nstudy. Analysis is to be performed by an independent, external statistician. In order to allow\\nadministrative decisions, the results of the primary endpoint will be disclosed unblinded (by\\ntreatment arm) to the Joint Development Committee.

The patient will be asked to provide written and signed\\n\\nconsent.\\n\\nIf the patient is illiterate or unable to write, s/he will include a mark in the form and a\\nliterate witness must sign (this person should have no connection to the research team and\\n\\nthe sponsor, and, if possible, should be selected by the participant).\\n\\nIf new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment,\\nthe consent form should be reviewed and updated if necessary. All patients (including those\\nalready being treated) should be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised\\n\\nform and give their consent to continue in the trial.\\n\\n15.2. Ethical aspects of patient inclusion and trial procedures\\n\\nOnly eligible patients for Chagas therapy according to national guidelines and for\\nwhom Benznidazole standard treatment is indicated will be enrolled in this trial. The\\nmanagement of their disease and therapy will follow national guidelines. In comparison with\\ncurrent BZN standard treatment, the new therapeutic approaches for CD using different doses\\nand duration of BZN, as well as combinations, target an improvement in treatment response\\n\\nand tolerability and reduce the potential for development of resistance.\\n\\nParticipants on this trial may experience discomfort during examination and blood\\n\\nsampling.\\n\\nConfidential Page 81 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 83 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018. Version 5.0.\\n\\nThe total volume of blood collected during the trial is about 322 mL for all evaluations\\n(around 20 table spoons). The amount of blood drawn does not cause anaemia or problems\\nrelated to the body’s defence mechanisms. The maximal quantity during 1 visit is 28mL\\n\\n(equivalent to 2 table spoons).\\n\\n15.3. Ethical aspects of trial treatments\\n\\nClinical data demonstrated that E1224 has potential for the specific treatment of T.\\ncruzi infections at EOT and with a proportion of patients sustaining parasitological response\\nuntil 6 months. Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers receiving E1224 suggest that the\\ninvestigational drug has a satisfactory safety profile. A Phase 1 drug-drug interaction trial which\\nassessed the interaction of BNZ and E1224 showed that both compounds were well tolerated,\\nin monotherapy and combination. The lack of clinically relevant safety findings provided\\nsupport for follow-up evaluation of the two compounds in combination. Likewise, experimental\\ndata suggest a positive interaction between BZN and azole compounds for the treatment of\\n\\nChagas disease.\\n\\nA placebo comparator has been selected for this trial. Due to the chronic nature of\\nChagas Disease and slow progression of organs impairment there is no evidence of a\\nsignificant risk for adult patients recruited to the placebo group within the timelines of trial\\nevaluation. All patients will be offered treatment at the end of the trial. This arm will provide a\\ncontrol for the therapeutic efficacy assessment of Benznidazole and BZN/E1224 alternative\\nregimens. In addition, it will allow a more complete evaluation of PCR as an outcome measure\\n\\nfor CD clinical trials.\\n\\n15.4. Patient costs\\nPatients will be reimbursed for travel to and from the trial site and in case of any lost\\nday(s) of work, but will not receive any payment for trial participation. Any treatment for trial-\\nrelated injuries that is required during the trial period will be provided free of charge to the\\n\\npatient.\\n\\n16. INSURANCE AND LIABILITY\\nDNDi will provide insurance against claims arising from the trial, except for claims that\\narise from malpractice and/or negligence. In addition, the DNDi will address the costs of\\ntreatment of trial patients in the event of trial-related injuries in accordance with the applicable\\n\\nregulatory requirements.\\n\\n17. REPORTING AND PUBLICATION\\nThis clinical trial will be registered with a recognized clinical trial registry and a final\\n\\nclinical trial report will be generated.\\n\\nConfidential Page 82 of 87\\n\\n\\n=== Page 84 ===\\nProtocol number DNDi-CH-E1224-003\\nMay 04, 2018.

Co-administration with E1224 is contraindicated\\n\\nVinca Alkaloids\\n\\nE1224 may increase the plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids\\n(e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) which may lead to neurotoxicity.\\nTherefore, it is recommended that the dose adjustment of the\\nvinca alkaloid be considered.\\n\\nTacrolimus\\n\\nFrequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood trough\\nconcentrations should be performed upon initiation, during co-\\nadministration, and at discontinuation of E1224 treatment, with\\ntacrolimus doses adjusted accordingly. Consider a 33%\\nreduction in dose upon start of E1224 therapy\\n\\nBenzodiazepines\\nmetabolized through\\nCYP3A4\\n\\nE1224 is likely to increase the plasma concentrations of\\nbenzodiazepines and lead to a prolonged sedative effect.
